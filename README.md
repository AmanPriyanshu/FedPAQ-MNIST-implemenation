# FedPAQ-MNIST-implemenation
An implementation of FedPAQ using different experimental parameters. We will be looking at different variations of how, r(number of clients to be selected), t (local epochs) and s (Quantizer levels))

## Analysis-Synopsis:

```csv

```

Some images to demonstrates - 
* local epochs (fixing precision and r to _ and _ respectively)
* r (fixing local_epochs and precision to _ and _ respectively)
* precision (fixing local_epochs and r to _ and _ respectively)
